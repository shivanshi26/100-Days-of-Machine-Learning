1. Gathering Data
This is the first step where data is collected from various sources.

Subcategories:
Data Collection: Identifying and gathering relevant data from different sources such as databases, web scraping, APIs, surveys, etc.
Data Acquisition: Importing data into the system where it will be stored and processed.
Data Logging: Keeping a record of where and how the data was collected for future reference and reproducibility.

2. Data Preparation
In this step, raw data is cleaned and transformed into a format suitable for analysis.

Subcategories:
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting errors, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
Data Transformation: Converting data into a suitable format or structure, which might involve normalization, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Data Integration: Combining data from multiple sources to provide a unified view.

3. Data Wrangling
This step involves transforming and mapping raw data into a more usable format.

Subcategories:
Data Exploration: Understanding the data through statistical summaries and visualizations.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models.
Data Reduction: Reducing the volume of data by techniques like dimensionality reduction or feature selection.

4. Analyzing Data
In this step, insights are derived from the data through various analysis techniques.

Subcategories:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using statistical methods and visualization tools to discover patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the data.
Hypothesis Testing: Testing assumptions or hypotheses about the data.
Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical methods to summarize and infer properties of the data.

5. Train the Model
This is where the actual machine learning happens. A model is trained using the prepared data.

Subcategories:
Selecting a Model: Choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithm(s) based on the problem and data.
Splitting Data: Dividing data into training and validation sets.
Training the Model: Feeding the training data into the model to learn from it.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjusting the model parameters to optimize performance.

6. Test the Model
The model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

Subcategories:
Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate the model’s performance.
Cross-Validation: Applying techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.
Model Comparison: Comparing the performance of different models and selecting the best one.

7. Deployment
The final step involves deploying the model to a production environment where it can be used to make predictions on new data.

Subcategories:
Model Integration: Integrating the model into an existing system or application.
Monitoring: Continuously monitoring the model’s performance in the production environment to ensure it performs as expected.
Maintenance: Updating the model as new data comes in or as the underlying data distribution changes (retraining).
These steps provide a comprehensive framework for developing, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models.
