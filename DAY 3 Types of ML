Different types of Machine Learning (ML). 
The types are categorized into four main groups: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Semi-Supervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. Here's a breakdown of each type:

### 1. Supervised Learning
- **Definition**: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data. This means each training example is paired with an output label.
- **Applications**:
  - **Regression**: Predicting continuous values, such as predicting house prices based on features like size, location, etc.
  - **Classification**: Assigning inputs to predefined categories, such as email spam detection (spam or not spam).

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition**: Unsupervised learning involves training the algorithm on data without labeled responses. The system tries to learn the patterns and structure from the input data.
- **Applications**:
  - **Clustering**: Grouping data points into clusters based on similarity, such as customer segmentation in marketing.
  - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of random variables to consider, making the dataset simpler and faster to process, such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
  - **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying rare items, events, or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.
  - **Association**: Discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases, such as market basket analysis in retail.

### 3. Semi-Supervised Learning
- **Definition**: Semi-supervised learning falls between supervised and unsupervised learning. It uses both labeled and unlabeled data for training, typically a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.
- **Applications**: This approach is useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming. It is used in scenarios where acquiring a fully labeled dataset is impractical.

### 4. Reinforcement Learning
- **Definition**: Reinforcement learning is about training algorithms to make sequences of decisions by rewarding them for good decisions and penalizing them for bad ones. The agent learns by interacting with its environment.
- **Applications**: Common in robotics, gaming, and navigation, such as training a robot to walk or an AI to play a video game.
